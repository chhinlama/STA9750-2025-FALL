title: "Hello! This is Chhin."

I am a **graduate student** at Baruch College, majoring in **Business Analytics**. Iâ€™m currently working in Tax, but I am planning to transition my career into Data Analytics because I find working with data both fascinating and powerful in solving real-world problems.

Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my family, traveling to new places, and trying new things.

I am always open to connecting - feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chhin-lama-50b493186)
